# basic-login-system-with-dictionary
basic terminal login system made with dictionary not bianry/text/csv files...... so, if you close the program it is gonna go back to initial settings only !!
so there is no exit .. ðŸ˜‚
use ctrl+c to interrupt..
i have commented out the exit command , you can uncomment it and it will work just fine.. 

this program can create update and remove login ids and password using basic dictionary in python.

two logins has been already created .. 
1 and 2 , both of their passwords are 123    
you can change or remove ....
